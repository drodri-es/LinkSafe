3. Install dependencies:
   npm install

4. Set up Firebase:
   - Make sure you have the Firebase CLI installed (npm install -g firebase-tools).
   - Log in to Firebase: firebase login
   - Initialize Firebase in your project if you haven't already: firebase init (select the features you need, like Firestore, Hosting, etc.)
   - Make sure you have set up your Firebase projects for different environments (e.g., production, staging) as mentioned in the prerequisites [5].
   - Ensure your App Hosting backend is set up and connected to the desired GitHub branch [5].

5. Configure environment variables:

   If you need to deploy other Firebase resources (like Firestore rules or functions), use the appropriate flags [6], for example:
   firebase deploy --only hosting,firestore,functions

8. Access your deployed site:
   - Your project will be available at the Firebase-provisioned URLs (e.g., PROJECT_ID.web.app, PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com) [6].

Remember to replace <your_github_repository_url> and <your_project_directory> with your actual GitHub repository URL and project directory name.
